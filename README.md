# 🐶 ButternutBox Modal Challenge 🐶

- Boostrapped this with create-react-app
- Run yarn && yarn start to run the project
- Any feedback would be appreciated

# Technologies used:

## 🦴 React
  - Hooks (First time I use them in a personal project)
  - React Portal
  - React-simple-calendar: https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-react-calendar
## 🦴 Styled Components
  - Hacked some styles in (Don't judge me please, limited time, although, not an excuse)
## 🦴 MomentJS
  - to format the date, could have used dayJS but I preffered not to waste time on searching for docs

### Thank you and have a great weekend!
