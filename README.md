# ButternutBox Modal Challenge

Technologies used:

## React
  - Hooks (First time I use them in a personal project)
  - React Portal
  - React calendar
## Styled Components
  - Hacked some styles in (Don't judge me please, limited time, although, not an excuse)
## MomentJS
  - to format the date, could have used dayJS but I preffered not to waste time on searching for docs
