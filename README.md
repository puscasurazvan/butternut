# 🐶 Modal Challenge 🐶

- Boostrapped this with create-react-app
- Clone repo, yarn && yarn start to run the project
- Any feedback would be appreciated

# Technologies used:

## 🦴 React
  - Hooks
  - React Portal
  - React-simple-calendar: https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-react-calendar (limited styling options though)


## 🦴 SASS
  - Initially used styled-components, and changed to SASS(BEM naming convention) to be able to customize styles better


## 🦴 DayJS
  - to format the date, used moment first time, changed to this as it's a 2kb library.
